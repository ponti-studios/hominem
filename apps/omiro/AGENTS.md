# Omiro agent instructions

Scoped to `apps/omiro`. The root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) is the primary
instruction authority; this file adds mobile-specific detail and must not
duplicate or contradict it.

## Expo and EAS

- `apps/omiro` uses Expo managed workflow with Metro package exports enabled.
- Shared ESM packages may use explicit `.js` imports while their source files are TypeScript. Keep the Omiro Metro resolver fallback that retries an explicit `.js` import without the extension so Metro can resolve the source file; do not rewrite shared Node ESM imports just to satisfy Metro.
- Pin `pnpm` in `apps/omiro/eas.json`'s `build.base` to match the root `package.json`'s `packageManager` version. Removing the pin was tried and broke production builds: the EAS builder image's preinstalled pnpm didn't match the workspace's required version and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` refused to run (`This project is configured to use X of pnpm. Your current pnpm is vY`). If a future EAS image update makes the pin itself conflict with Corepack (`npm ERR! EEXIST`), reconcile by matching the pin to `packageManager` exactly rather than removing it.
- Verify an EAS fix with the same embed command used by the build: `pnpm --filter @hominem/omiro exec expo export:embed --eager --platform ios --dev false`.
- The `eas.json` `build.base.pnpm` pin only covers `type: build` jobs; `submit`/`update` job types run on a separate runner that ignores it. If one of those fails on a pnpm version mismatch, add a `before_install_node_modules: corepack prepare pnpm@<version> --activate` hook to that job — don't loosen `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `pmOnFail`/`engineStrict`/supply-chain settings to work around it.
- Always `export APP_ENV=production` before any local `eas build`/`eas submit`/`eas config` command targeting production, even with `--id`. Expo's CLI auto-loads gitignored `.env.*.local` files during local config evaluation, which can silently override the app identity that `eas.json`'s per-profile `env` block intends. See the `omiro-release` skill for the full release pipeline.

## Navigation and components

- Uses Expo Router file-based routes. Route files live in `apps/omiro/app/`; the `~` alias maps to the Omiro project root.
- Navigation architecture is user-owned. Do not introduce a root tab bar, remove a context from the header, move Tasks into a separate root destination, or otherwise change the Chats/Notes/Tasks information architecture without explicit approval in the current user request and governing spec.
- `app/(auth)/` contains unauthenticated screens. `app/(protected)/` requires auth and is guarded through `resolveAuthRedirect` in its layout. Auth redirect logic lives in `services/navigation/auth-route-guard.ts`.
- Root provider order is `GestureHandlerRootView` → `SafeAreaProvider` → `KeyboardProvider` → `QueryClientProvider` → `AuthProvider` → `PostHogProvider`. Do not add a provider without checking that chain.
- Use `makeStyles` and `theme` from `~/components/theme`; do not introduce hardcoded style values through raw `StyleSheet.create`.

## Commands

```bash
just mobile rebuild              # first run or native/config change
just mobile run                  # everyday JS/TS development
just mobile check                # focused CI-equivalent lane
just mobile maestro [flow]       # run isolated E2E Metro and collect device evidence
```

## Evidence

A user-visible interaction requires Maestro evidence on the booted iPhone simulator and visual inspection of every changed acceptance state. A type check or unit test may supplement this evidence but never replace it.

Root-scene gestures also require evidence for the exact interaction, interruption, accessibility, Reduce Motion, and smallest supported viewport behavior. If an enhancement is unsupported or fails, use the normal Expo Router Stack behavior and record the limitation.

## Testing the omiro app (iOS Simulator)

Use **Maestro** for programmatic UI testing of `apps/omiro`. The app is installed on the booted simulator as `com.pontistudios.hakumi.dev`.

**Prerequisites — Java 17 must be on PATH before running Maestro:**

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH"
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17"
```

**Launch the app:**

```bash
xcrun simctl launch booted com.pontistudios.hakumi.dev
```

**Take a screenshot:**

```bash
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot /tmp/omiro_screen.png
```

**Run a Maestro flow:**

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.maestro/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH" && export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17" && maestro test my_flow.yaml
```

(The Maestro CLI lives at `~/.maestro/bin`, not on a default PATH.)

**Canonical local run:** use `just mobile maestro [flow-or-directory]`. It
starts or reuses a scripted local API, reuses the installed development client
with an isolated E2E Metro session, then checks Java 17, the booted simulator,
and installed app; cleans a stale Maestro/XCTest bridge; and authenticates once
before running the requested evidence flow(s).
Individual flows assume that authenticated baseline and should not be launched
directly.

**E2E login:** OTPs are real random codes captured to the scripted mailbox —
never hardcoded. The runner uses the two-phase wrapper and forces scripted API
providers. The wrapper force-resets the app first — terminates it, wipes
`Documents/mmkv` (the persisted react-query cache + resume-target local
store) and relaunches with `clearKeychain: true` — so every login starts from
a clean signed-out state and a stale cache can't strand the session on a 404'd
detail screen:

```bash
apps/omiro/tests/scripts/maestro-auth.sh [email]  # default e2e@test.hakumi.io
```

The reset lives in `tests/subflows/reset-app-state.yaml`; only the bootstrap
resets — the flows themselves still assume an authenticated session.

**Suite layout:** `tests/config.yaml` covers `flows/**` + `e2e/**` (never run
`subflows/**` standalone — most have no `launchApp`); `.maestro/config.yaml`
covers the exploratory suite minus `startup.yaml`. Run subsets with
`maestro test --config <config> --include-tags=smoke|a11y ...`.

**Maestro flow skeleton:**

```yaml
appId: com.pontistudios.hakumi.dev
---
- launchApp
- assertVisible: 'Omiro'
- tapOn:
    id: 'feed-composer-input' # use testID values from source
- inputText: 'some text'
- takeScreenshot: /tmp/omiro_step
```

Tap targets use the React Native `testID` prop. Key IDs already in the codebase:

- `feed-composer` — the composer shell on the home screen
- `feed-composer-input` — the text input inside the home composer
- `chat-composer` / `chat-composer-input` — same for the chat detail screen

**Known issue — always tap by `id`, not by fuzzy text:** iOS's accessibility tree merges all children of a screen (e.g. a bottom sheet) into a single node whenever no text field currently has focus. When that happens, `tapOn: text: '...'` (or the Maestro MCP `tap_on` tool's `text` param) resolves to the center point of that merged node's bounds — which is often the modal backdrop, not the element you meant — and silently dismisses the sheet instead of tapping the target. Tapping by `id` (i.e. the element's `testID`) works reliably regardless of focus state and does not suffer from this merging. Prefer `id` selectors over `text` selectors for anything inside a modal/sheet.
