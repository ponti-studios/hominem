# Hominem development

This skill is the repository's development runbook and also holds the
development and deployment rules and environment-variable facts that used to
live in `docs/development.md`. Per the root [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md), you
may start local dev services yourself (Expo/Metro, `pnpm dev`, the API,
workers, databases, Docker) when a task needs one running. Prefer the Browser
pane's `preview_start` for anything you'll drive or screenshot in a browser.
Stop services you started once you're done with them, unless the user is
actively using them.

`.claude/launch.json`'s `career`/`finance`/`web` entries open the Browser
pane at `http://localhost:<port>`, not the portless `https://<name>.lvh.me`
URL, even though `pnpm dev` itself still runs those apps through portless.
The Claude Code (desktop app) Browser pane blocks JS/CSS/HMR asset requests
to `*.lvh.me` outright, regardless of port. Confirmed empirically
(2026-09-10) via `fetch()` run from inside the pane: requests to `lvh.me`,
`web.lvh.me`, and `api.lvh.me` all fail the same way at both port 443 (the
proxy's current port, see below) and port 4200 (its old port), while
ordinary public domains (`example.com`, `google.com`) load fine in the same
pane. That rules out port as the cause — this is a domain/TLD-based block,
not a port-based one, and switching the proxy's port does not fix it. It
matches the Consequences section of
[the local dev domain ADR](../../../docs/decisions/auth.local-tld.md), which
separately documented `.test`/`.localhost` loading freely in this same pane
while `lvh.me`/`localtest.me` don't — consistent with an allowlist in the
pane's own safety layer keyed on TLD.

(A *different*, previously-observed restriction applies to a Claude Code
cloud/remote session's own egress proxy, which does not support non-443
HTTPS ports — see `/root/.ccr/README.md` inside such a session. That one is
genuinely port-based, but it's a separate sandbox from the desktop Browser
pane tested above; don't conflate the two.)

Either way, loading the app's own fixed local port in the Browser pane
avoids the block entirely. The tradeoff: `localhost` doesn't share the
cross-subdomain `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN=lvh.me` session cookie (see
[docs/authentication.md](../../../docs/authentication.md)), so a login
performed through the Browser pane on `localhost` won't persist across apps
the way it does when testing directly against the portless `lvh.me` origins
(e.g. via `curl`/Playwright, which aren't subject to the pane's block). For
an authenticated preview, drive the portless origins directly instead of
the Browser pane.

## First-time setup: env files in a new worktree

A freshly created worktree has none of the git-ignored `.env` files each
app/service/package needs (they hold real secrets, so they're never
committed). Copy them over from the main checkout in one step:

```bash
scripts/sync-worktree-env.sh            # copies whatever's missing
scripts/sync-worktree-env.sh --dry-run  # preview without changing anything
scripts/sync-worktree-env.sh --force    # also overwrite files that already exist
```

It never overwrites an existing file by default, so it's safe to re-run.
Copying alone would leave the main checkout's plain portless hostnames
(`api.lvh.me`, `career.lvh.me`, ...) in place, but a linked worktree
is actually served at a branch-prefixed hostname (see "First-time setup:
portless proxy" below) — so for every file it just copied, the script also
resolves this worktree's real URLs via `pnpm exec portless get <name>` and
patches the `API_URL`/`WEB_URL`/`CAREER_URL`/`FINANCE_URL`/
`VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL`/`HOMINEM_INTERNAL_API_URL`/`PUBLIC_APP_URL` values in
place. This needs the portless proxy already running (see below) — if it
isn't, the script leaves the copied URLs as-is and says so; start the proxy
and re-run with `--force` to patch them. It only ever touches files it just
copied in that same run, so a file that already existed (and was therefore
skipped) is never rewritten — hand-edited values are left alone.

## First-time setup: portless proxy

`pnpm dev` for `api`/`web`/`career`/`finance` runs through
[portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless), configured per-package
(each app's `package.json` has its own `"portless": { "name", "script" }`
key — see below; there is no root `portless.json`), which gives each service
a stable `https://<name>.lvh.me` URL instead of
a fixed port — this is what lets the same app run from multiple worktrees
without a port collision (portless prefixes the worktree's branch name onto
the hostname automatically).

The TLD is `lvh.me`, not the `.localhost` default — `lvh.me` is a public
domain with wildcard DNS to `127.0.0.1` (like `nip.io`), and it has to be a
real registrable domain for cross-subdomain login to work at all: Chrome
(confirmed empirically) silently refuses to set any cookie with
`Domain=localhost` or `Domain=.localhost`, even though the `Set-Cookie`
response header looks completely correct — there's no client-visible error,
sign-in just quietly never persists a session. `apps/*/playwright.config.ts`
already relies on the same `lvh.me` fact for e2e cross-subdomain auth.

Don't reach for `--tld test` as a fix for this — it hits the identical wall.
Chrome's restriction isn't specific to the literal string "localhost"; it
covers the whole RFC 2606 reserved special-use-TLD group (`localhost`,
`test`, `example`, `invalid`), confirmed empirically the same way. Portless
itself supports any custom `--tld`, and a self-hosted reverse proxy (Caddy,
etc.) with its own local CA doesn't change this either — the constraint is
Chrome's cookie policy, not the proxying layer. Only a real, non-reserved
registrable domain works. See
[the local dev domain ADR](../../../docs/decisions/auth.local-tld.md) for the full
investigation and the alternatives ruled out.

The proxy runs on port 443 (the default HTTPS port, so origins need no
`:port` suffix — just `https://<name>.lvh.me`), bound as a **root-owned
launchd service** installed once via:

```bash
sudo pnpm exec portless service install --tld lvh.me
```

This writes `/Library/LaunchDaemons/sh.portless.proxy.plist`
(`RunAtLoad`/`KeepAlive` both true), so the proxy starts at boot and
restarts itself if it ever dies — no per-session `sudo` needed, and no
elevation-prompt-hangs-in-a-non-interactive-session problem, since nothing
short of a reboot or `sudo portless service uninstall` ever needs to start
it again. (Portless used to run on an unprivileged port, 4200, started ad
hoc per session specifically to dodge the `sudo` requirement — the repo
moved off that in favor of port 443 plus this always-on service; see
[the local dev domain ADR](../../../docs/decisions/auth.local-tld.md) for
the record of that tradeoff.) Check `pnpm exec portless service status`
if you're unsure whether it's installed and running. Once it's up,
`pnpm dev` runs auto-attach to it instead of trying to start their own.
`.env.example` defaults already point at `https://<name>.lvh.me` (no
port).

Each of `api`/`web`/`career`/`finance`'s `package.json` has its own
`"portless": { "name", "script": "dev:app" }` key — that's what portless
actually reads when a package's own `"dev": "portless"` script runs (a root
`portless.json` apps map is only consulted for the bare, monorepo-wide
`portless` command, which this repo's turbo-driven `pnpm dev` never uses).
If you add a new portless-fronted app, give it this key, not a root config
entry.

## Verifying the local stack

After dependency or React catalog changes, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
and restart SSR apps before browser tests. An already-running Vite/React
Router process can retain an older `react-dom` version and produce a misleading
SSR `useContext` failure even though the workspace install is now consistent.

Smoke-test the actual origins selected for the run:

```bash
curl -k -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://api.lvh.me/
curl -k -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://web.lvh.me/chats
curl -k -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://career.lvh.me/
curl -k -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://finance.lvh.me/
```

The Web `/chats` endpoint returning `302` is expected when the browser is not
authenticated; it proves the Web server and auth redirect are reachable.
When using the fixed-port Browser harness, use `http://localhost:4040` and
`http://localhost:4445` instead and do not mix the two origin sets in one run.

For authenticated Playwright runs, prepare the stable disposable session in
the same shell that starts Playwright:

```bash
eval "$(pnpm --filter @hominem/api --silent e2e:setup 2>/dev/null | grep 'export ')"
pnpm --filter @hominem/web test:e2e --project=chat
```

The Playwright auth setup requires `E2E_SESSION_COOKIE`; skipped scenarios must
retain their exact harness limitation in the evidence rather than being
counted as passing.

Because portless gives each app its own subdomain (`api.lvh.me`,
`career.lvh.me`, `finance.lvh.me`, `web.lvh.me`) rather than just a
different port on the same host, the hosted-login session cookie needs
`services/api`'s `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN=lvh.me` (see `.env.example`) to be
shared across them via Better Auth's cross-subdomain cookies — without it,
login appears to succeed but the other apps never see the session and bounce
back to `/login`. See [docs/authentication.md](../../../docs/authentication.md)
for the full cookie-domain mechanism.

`services/api`'s hosted login page ships a client bundle
(`public/login.js`) built from `src/routes/login/browser.ts` — this is a
committed artifact, not compiled at request time, so a source-only edit to
`browser.ts` has no effect until it's rebuilt. `pnpm dev`/`dev:api` handles
this automatically (see [services/api/AGENTS.md](../../../services/api/AGENTS.md)); an out-of-band build needs
`node build.mjs` run from `services/api`, with the regenerated
`public/login.js` committed alongside the source change.

## Smallest loop by default

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm --filter @hominem/api dev`
3. `pnpm test --filter=@hominem/api...`

When working on the API or shared backend code, run the fuller API validation
lane instead:

1. Start the local test services you need.
2. `pnpm lint --filter=@hominem/api...`, `pnpm typecheck --filter=@hominem/api...`, `pnpm build --filter=@hominem/api...`, `pnpm test --filter=@hominem/api...`
3. `pnpm build` for a full workspace build when needed

For Omiro work, use the app bootstrap loop in
[apps/omiro/README.md](../../../apps/omiro/README.md):

1. `just mobile prebuild development`
2. `just mobile dev`

## Canonical commands

- `pnpm install` — install dependencies and prepare the repo toolchain
- `pnpm run check` — full pre-push validation (lint → typecheck → build → test via turbo)
- `pnpm dev` / `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm build` / `pnpm test` — run for every package, or scope with `--filter=@hominem/<pkg>...`
- `pnpm format` — apply formatting across the repo
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` — lint the repo, or lint and apply fixes
- `just db backup` — timestamped SQL backup of the dev database in `~/.hominem/`
- `just db migrate [test]` — apply database migrations
- `just db codegen` — regenerate database types against the caller's `DATABASE_URL`
- `pnpm --filter @hominem/api merge-user-data` — dry-run-first, insert-only local-to-production user-data merge (see below)
- `just mobile <action>` — iOS development, test, build, update, release commands
- `cd ~/Developer/infra/foundation && just up` / `just health` / `just down` — local infrastructure, including the OTLP Collector and Jaeger

Use the smallest relevant validation command first (`pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/
`build`/`test`, scoped with `--filter=@hominem/<package>...`), not `pnpm run check`
for every small change.

## Local OpenTelemetry

Start the foundation stack before running the API when you want local traces.
The API and worker export to `http://localhost:4318` from local env config.

- Jaeger: `http://localhost:16686`
- Collector logs: `cd ~/Developer/infra/foundation && just logs otel-collector`
- Local application logs stay in the service terminal

## Production user-data merge

```bash
pnpm --filter @hominem/api merge-user-data --sourceEmail <email> --targetEmail <email>
```

This plans a merge without writing to either database. Requires
`SOURCE_DATABASE_URL` and `TARGET_DATABASE_URL`; resolves one user in each
database; verifies the complete Goose history and app schema fingerprint;
writes a permission-restricted manifest under
`~/.hominem/user-data-merges/`.

Only after reviewing that manifest, run with `--apply --yes`. The tool then:

- creates a production `pg_dump` backup beside the manifest,
- inserts rows atomically, never updates or deletes production data,
- aborts on any non-identical primary-key or unique-key collision,
- excludes `app.ai_usage_events` and every `app.purchase_*` table.

For Railway, use a temporary tunnel as `TARGET_DATABASE_URL`, then close it
after the command finishes:

```bash
pnpm dlx @railway/cli@5.25.1 connect database --tunnel-only --environment production
```

## Development rules

- Use `just` and the root `pnpm` scripts as the repository command interface. Package scripts are Turbo implementation details, not contributor instructions.
- Start with the smallest relevant validation command: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, or `pnpm test`. Scope it with `--filter=@hominem/<package>...`, for example `--filter=@hominem/api...`.
- The monorepo resolves types through compiled declaration contracts, not source. Package `exports` `types` conditions point at `build/`, and declaration emit is a types-only artifact. Run `pnpm dev:types` alongside `pnpm dev` when editing shared types: composite packages are watched via `tsc -b`, while the API/RPC boundaries use declaration-only emit watchers. Runtime (tsx, metro, vite) runs from source and is unaffected. If a type change ripples further than one hop, restart the TypeScript server. See [docs/type-system.md](../../../docs/type-system.md) for the model, why the watcher is shaped the way it is, and what else was tried to speed up type-checking.
- Published shared packages expose compiled artifacts. Local development may use source aliases for hot reload, but CI, deployables, EAS, and external consumers must use the same compiled public exports.
- Keep the shared UI package registry-resolved in manifests and lockfiles. Use `just ui link [path]`, `just ui status`, and `just ui unlink` for a reversible local source link. Never commit the local path.
- Use the same Node and pnpm versions in local development, CI, Docker, Railway, and EAS. A version mismatch is a defect.
- `@hominem/env` defines shared environment-variable behavior. Framework prefixes adapt a variable for a runtime; they must not give it a second meaning.
- Redact secrets from logs. Use a safe identifier instead of a raw third-party URL when one is available.

## Deployment rules

Each production service must have one deployment authority. A Railway service
managed by GitHub must not also use Railway linked-source auto-deploy.

A deployment target is identified by this set of values:

```text
repository + logical service + immutable Railway service ID
+ checked-in configuration path + triggering workflow
```

An accepted upload does not prove that deployment succeeded. Automation must
verify the resolved target and the final remote deployment state.

Omiro's mobile delivery, release, and app-specific implementation notes are
documented in [the Omiro README](../../../apps/omiro/README.md). General
repository and deployment rules remain here.
