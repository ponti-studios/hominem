# Sourceable library for authenticating as the stable test user or an isolated
# synthetic account against the local Better Auth email-OTP flow. Every feature-specific
# e2e driver (collection invites, and future ones) should `source` this
# instead of reimplementing OTP/cookie/safety-rail logic — auth setup is the
# same regardless of which resource the test is actually exercising.
#
# Usage from another driver.sh:
#   source ".../hominem-auth-e2e/lib.sh"
#   hominem_signup "invitee-e2e@test.hominem.dev"
#   curl -b "$(hominem_cookiejar_for "invitee-e2e@test.hominem.dev")" ...
#
# Not meant to be executed directly — see driver.sh in this directory for a
# standalone CLI over the same functions.

# delete-user — see the guard in hominem_delete_user below), so a future
# Claude can default to this account instead of minting a fresh disposable
# one for every single-user test. Only spin up @test.hominem.dev accounts
# when a test genuinely needs more than one distinct identity (e.g. an
# owner + an invitee).
