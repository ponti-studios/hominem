description: Build, run, and screenshot the omiro Expo/React Native app on the iOS Simulator. Use when asked to run omiro, start the mobile app, launch it on the simulator, take a screenshot of the app UI, or verify a mobile change actually works.
---

Omiro is an Expo (React Native) dev-client app. Developers use
`just mobile run` and `just mobile rebuild`. For unattended agent automation
only, `.agents/skills/run-omiro/driver.sh` wraps the underlying Expo and
simulator operations so an agent does not have to babysit background processes
or guess simulator UDIDs.

All paths below are relative to the repo root. macOS + Xcode + a simulator
runtime are required — there is no Linux/headless path for iOS Simulator
builds.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode installed with at least one iOS Simulator runtime (`xcrun simctl list devices available`).
- The repo's API service reachable at `http://localhost:4040` (or whatever `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` you set) — check with `driver.sh status`. Without it, screens that fetch data will error, though the app still boots.
- pnpm deps installed at the repo root (`pnpm install`).

## Setup

```bash
.agents/skills/run-omiro/driver.sh env
```

Copies `.env.example` → `.env.development.local` if missing, and strips
the placeholder `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` line (see Gotchas — a
placeholder or empty value there crashes every route).

## Run (agent path)

First build (only needed once per native-project reset — Expo dev
clients don't need rebuilding for JS-only changes):

```bash
.agents/skills/run-omiro/driver.sh build      # boots a sim, expo run:ios, installs, launches
```

Day-to-day (JS-only changes, app already installed):

```bash
.agents/skills/run-omiro/driver.sh metro      # idempotent: starts Metro in bg if not already up
.agents/skills/run-omiro/driver.sh launch     # terminate + relaunch, reconnects to Metro
.agents/skills/run-omiro/driver.sh screenshot /tmp/omiro.png
```

Or all at once from a cold start:

```bash
.agents/skills/run-omiro/driver.sh all
```

| command             | what it does                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `env`               | writes/fixes `.env.development.local`                                                 |
| `boot`              | boots a simulator if none is booted, prints UDID                                      |
| `build`             | `expo run:ios`; falls back to manual `simctl install` if devicectl install fails      |
| `metro`             | starts `expo start --clear` in background, waits for `:8081/status` to report running |
| `launch`            | `simctl terminate` + `simctl launch` the installed app (reconnects to Metro)          |
| `screenshot [path]` | `simctl io screenshot`, default `/tmp/omiro-sim.png`                                  |
| `status`            | prints booted simulator, Metro status, API reachability                               |
| `all`               | env → boot → metro → build → launch → screenshot                                      |

Metro log: `/tmp/omiro-metro.log`. Metro pid: `/tmp/omiro-metro.pid`.

After `launch`, wait ~5-10s before screenshotting — the JS bundle needs
a moment even when Metro's cache is warm.

## Run (human path)

```bash
just mobile rebuild # first run or native/config change
just mobile run     # everyday JavaScript/TypeScript work
```

## Test

```bash
just mobile check
```

## Gotchas

- **`expo run:ios --device "iPhone 17 Pro"` can target a _shutdown_
  simulator** when more than one device shares that name (this
  project's simctl list had two "iPhone 17 Pro" entries). The install
  step then fails with `ERROR: The capability "Install Application" is
not supported by this device.` — devicectl refuses to install onto a
  non-booted device. `driver.sh build` boots a simulator by name
  _first_ and installs manually via `simctl install` + `simctl launch`
  as a fallback if `expo run:ios`'s own install step fails.
- **Empty/placeholder `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` crashes every route.**
  The env schema (`env.ts`) declares it `z.url().optional()` —
  `.optional()` only tolerates an _absent_ key, not `""` or the
  `.env.example` placeholder string. Either fails Zod validation and
  every route throws `Cannot read property 'ErrorBoundary' of
undefined` before rendering anything. Delete the line outright
  rather than blanking its value.
- **Missing `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` fails the same way** — the app
  never gets past the splash screen, with a `ZodError: Missing
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` repeated once per route in the Metro log.
  Always run `driver.sh env` before first launch.
- **A relaunch right after `expo start --clear` shows only the splash
  screen for several seconds** — Metro is bundling on first connect
  even though the CLI already printed "Waiting on http://localhost:8081".
  Don't screenshot immediately after `launch`; poll or sleep ~5-10s.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Error: ERROR: The capability "Install Application" is not
supported by this device.`**: target simulator wasn't booted. Run
  `driver.sh boot` before `build`, or use `driver.sh build` which does
  this automatically.
- **`[ZodError: ... "Missing EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL"]` spamming the
  Metro log, app stuck on splash**: run `driver.sh env`, then restart
  Metro (`pkill -f "expo start"` then `driver.sh metro`) and
  `driver.sh launch` again — Metro caches env at startup, so an env
  fix requires a Metro restart, not just an app relaunch.
- **`[ZodError: ... "EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN" ... Invalid URL]`**: same
  fix — the var is present but invalid; `driver.sh env` deletes it.
