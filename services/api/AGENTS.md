# API agent instructions

Scoped to `services/api`. The root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) is the primary
instruction authority; this file adds API-specific detail and must not
duplicate or contradict it.

## Implementation rules

`services/api` is a Hono HTTP server and BullMQ worker. Its entry points are `src/index.ts` for HTTP and `src/worker.ts` for jobs.

- `AppEnv` in `src/server.ts` declares Hono's context variable map. Auth middleware sets `ctx.var.user`, `ctx.var.userId`, and `ctx.var.auth`; route handlers read those values and do not re-fetch the user.
- A route lives in `src/routes/<name>.ts` as a `Hono<AppEnv>` instance and is registered from `src/server.ts` with `app.route('/path', myRoutes)`. Apply `authJwtMiddleware` only when its route-specific protection is needed.
- `src/rpc/app.ts` is the type-safe RPC contract consumed by clients through `@hominem/api/types`. Update affected clients in the same change as an RPC contract change.
- Use `isServiceError` from `src/errors.ts` for known domain failures. Throw typed errors and let the global handler map them to HTTP responses.
- Job handlers live in `src/workers/` and register in `src/worker.ts`. The worker is a separate process and shares no HTTP-server memory.
- Use `pnpm --filter @hominem/api build` for the complete API build (browser assets, server/worker bundles, and declarations). `node build.mjs` builds only the server and worker bundles. Use `pnpm test --filter=@hominem/api...` and `pnpm --filter @hominem/api dev` for its normal lanes.
- Hosted-login browser assets are built by Vite. In development Vite runs in middleware mode inside the API's Node server, so its HMR endpoints share the Portless API origin. In production `pnpm build:assets` emits content-hashed assets and a manifest to `dist/public`; `PageFrame` resolves its CSS and browser entry from that manifest. Never commit generated browser assets or CSS.

## Career domain

- `app.career_applications.status` is `NOT NULL` with no column default, and a constraint trigger (`20260810150000_normalize_career_application_pipeline.sql`) rejects any status other than `WISHLIST`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, or `WITHDRAWN` unless the application already has a matching active pipeline stage (`APPLIED` needs an `APPLICATION`-kind stage, `SCREENING` needs `SCREEN`, `OFFER` needs `OFFER`). A stage-less create must default to `status: 'WISHLIST'` — see `createCareerApplication` in `src/application/career.service.ts`. Any test or script inserting directly into `app.career_applications` needs an explicit `status` for the same reason.
- MCP tools and RPC routes for a resource are thin adapters over one `src/application/<domain>.service.ts` implementation and one set of `src/schemas/<domain>.schema.ts` Zod schemas — never fork query logic or validation between the two surfaces. Follow the `hominem-resource` skill when adding or reviewing a resource.

## Production authentication

- Better Auth is the sole authentication authority. Preserve its session database, signed cookies, and native client storage contract.
- Do not add custom token or session storage when the Better Auth surface already exists.
- Email OTP delivery is scripted outside production: `ENV=scripted` selects the scripted provider, otherwise production sends via Resend and other environments capture outbound mail to the same-host scripted mailbox (`src/testkit/resend.mock.ts`, `@hominem/utils/scripted-mailbox`). Scripted boot is refused in production. `ENV=scripted` also selects the scripted AI provider. OTPs are never retrievable over HTTP — E2E helpers read the mailbox file; for a manual dev login, run `just otp <email>` (see [docs/authentication.md](../docs/authentication.md)) instead of reading the JSONL file by hand.
- A `200` response from the OTP request endpoint does not prove delivery. Check the email provider path without logging OTPs, tokens, cookies, or credentials.
- Never rotate `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` casually. Better Auth signs session cookies with it; changing it can invalidate every stored client session even when the database session rows still exist.
- When investigating a production auth incident, check the API deployment status, `/api/status`, auth HTTP status patterns, the active email provider (logged at boot), and aggregate session counts/expiry through an approved Railway database tunnel. Do not retrieve session tokens or user records.
