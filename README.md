## Hakumi monorepo

Hakumi is a notes-first personal workspace. This repo contains the product apps, shared packages, and services that power capture, notes, and chat across platforms.

This repo uses Bun as the package manager and script runner.

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.3.0
- Node.js 22.14.0

Toolchain versions are pinned in `.tool-versions` and `.node-version`.

Run a local environment check:

- `bun run dev:doctor`

### Common tasks

- Install deps:

	bun install

- Build all packages:

	bun run build

- Develop (example):

	bun run dev

### Script standard

Root scripts are intentionally minimal during the rebuild:

- `bun run dev`
- `bun run build`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run lint` (workspace lint + native typecheck + duplication)
- `bun run format`

Use filtering for targeted work instead of extra root aliases:

- `bun run build --filter @hominem/web`
- `bun run test --filter @hominem/api`
- `bun run dev --filter @hominem/api --filter @hominem/web`
- `bun run --filter @hominem/mobile check:expo-config`
- `bun run --filter @hominem/api test:auth:contract`

Workspace scripts should follow `verb[:qualifier]` and keep names aligned with behavior.

### Rebuild command surface

The repo is in a rebuild phase. Use the root `Makefile` only for:

- core orchestration
- local infra bootstrap
- current DB verification helpers

Older deploy/mobile/database convenience targets have been removed from the root surface and should be reintroduced only when they match the rebuilt architecture.

### Canonical Docs

- Product docs: `docs/README.md`
- Observability: `docs/observability.md`
- Rebuild reset: `docs/rebuild-reset.md`
- Local setup: `.github/skills/setup-workflow/SKILL.md`
- Deployment: `.github/skills/deployment-workflow/SKILL.md`
- Docker: `.github/skills/docker-workflow/SKILL.md`

### Sharing skills between projects

Skills are defined under `.github/skills` and are repo‑scoped.  To move them
elsewhere you can use the CLI helpers:

```bash
# from the source repository
hominem skills export /tmp/skills-export

# in the new repository
hominem skills import /tmp/skills-export
```

The commands simply copy the directory tree, creating the destination as
needed.  Once imported you can commit the files in the new project as usual.

### MCP server auth (single source of truth)

The MCP server reads its auth token from a config file only.

- Path: ~/.hominem/config.json (override with HOMINEM_CONFIG_PATH or HOMINEM_CONFIG_DIR)
- Format:

	{ "token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" }

Optional API endpoint overrides for MCP HTTP tools:

- HOMINEM_API_HOST (default: localhost)
- HOMINEM_API_PORT (default: 4040)
