# Task creation from chat

Turning a conversation into durable work is one shared flow, not two. A
transcript can resolve into a single task or a set of grouped tasks - the
distinction is a side effect of how many tasks are found, not a separate
product action the user picks up front.

## Entry point

Chat's conversation actions menu (`apps/omiro/components/chat/conversation-actions.model.ts`)
offers exactly two transforms: `note` ("Save as note") and `task_list`
("Create tasks"). There is no standalone "create one task" action - `task` as
an `ArtifactType` still exists (`packages/chat/src/capture-types.ts`) and can
be created directly through `POST /api/tasks`, but the chat transform surface
only ever proposes `task_list`.

## How "Create tasks" works

One shared hook backs the action on every surface: `useTaskExtraction`
(`@hominem/chat/react`, `packages/chat/src/use-task-extraction.ts`),
orchestrated through `useChatLifecycle`. Each platform supplies a thin
adapter — `apps/omiro/hooks/use-task-extraction.ts` on mobile,
`apps/web/app/routes/chat/chat.$chatId.tsx` on web — injecting its RPC
calls, cache invalidation, user-facing copy, and error presentation, plus
the shared review surface described below. There is no per-platform
reimplementation of the flow.

1. **Extract** - the transcript is sent to `POST /api/tasks/extract`
   (`services/api/src/rpc/routes/tasks.extract.ts`), which calls
   `extractTasks` (`services/api/src/application/task-extraction.service.ts`, OpenRouter structured output)
   with `TASK_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` and returns `{ groups, tasks }`: named
   groups of genuinely related steps (2+ tasks each) plus standalone
   items. Rate-limited (`ai-task-extract`, 20/min) and gated by the
   caller's monthly AI usage limit. A model-returned one-item group is
   demoted to standalone at parse time so it cannot fail the extraction.
2. **Review** - the drafts render as a shared lifecycle/proposal model in a
   platform-specific review surface (`ClassificationReview` on mobile and
   `ChatTaskReview` (`chat-task-review.tsx`, with per-item group titles
   and per-item reject tracked locally) on web) as a `task_list`-typed
   proposal; the user can accept or reject before anything is persisted.
   Proposal items receive stable client-local IDs plus their extraction
   group index (titles are display-only and not unique) so duplicate
   titles remain independently usable.
3. **Create** - on accept, the hook reconstitutes `{groups, tasks}` from
   the accepted subset (a group left with fewer than 2 items after
   rejection is demoted to standalone), splits acceptance into as many
   `POST /api/tasks/batch` calls as the endpoint caps require (10 groups
   / 20 standalone / 20 per group per call; groups stay atomic across
   calls), and persists via `persistExtractedTasks`
   (`services/api/src/application/tasks.service.ts`):
   - **Each group** -> a parent row with `artifactType: 'task_list'` titled
     with the model's group title, plus child task rows under it via
     `parentTaskId`.
   - **Each standalone draft** -> its own top-level row with
     `artifactType: 'task'`, no parent.
   - **Nothing accepted** -> nothing is sent; all writes happen in one
     transaction per batch call (except the single-standalone fast path).
   Response shape is `{ groups: [{ parent, tasks }], tasks }`.

The hook then resolves a canonical `SessionSource` (`kind: 'artifact'`, the
created row's real `artifactType`) so the surrounding chat state updates
immediately - the user never sees the artifact type they were promised
("task list") diverge from what actually got saved.

### Platform adapters

- **Mobile** (`apps/omiro/hooks/use-task-extraction.ts`) - maps
  `ChatMessageItem`s to `{ role, content }`, calls the RPC client, and
  invalidates `taskKeys.all` after creation; errors surface via `Alert.alert`.
- **Web** (`apps/web/app/routes/chat/chat.$chatId.tsx`) - maps
  `ChatMessageView`s the same way, calls the same endpoints through
  `useApiClient`, and invalidates `['tasks']` after creation. Dialog states map onto the
  lifecycle: `classifying` shows the extracting shimmer,
  `reviewing_changes` shows `ChatTaskReview` (`chat-task-review.tsx`, with
  per-item reject tracked locally and the accepted subset passed to
  `handleAcceptReview`), `persisting` drives its saving state, and failures
  land in the dialog's error panel with retry. The accepted subset — not
  the full proposal — is what gets created.

### Recovery and submitted meaning

- **Preserve submitted meaning** - users should not lose the meaning of what
  they submitted even if secondary automation (like task extraction) fails.
  Preserve the raw transcript before any optional cleanup. If task extraction
  fails, show the transcript so the user can recover it and continue without
  losing the original content.

"Save as note" is a separate, unrelated path: `ChatScreen` intercepts that
menu item before it reaches `useTaskExtraction` and routes to
`chat-to-note-sheet.tsx` (an AI rewrite of the transcript into note content,
not a deterministic task extraction).

## Adjacent extraction paths

- `POST /api/tasks/voice` - same idea for a voice transcript
  (`extractVoiceTasks`, same service and route module as `/extract`), its
  own rate-limit bucket (`ai-task-voice`).
- `POST /api/tasks/parse` - time-block parsing for calendar scheduling
  (`extractTimeBlock` in
  `services/api/src/application/time-block-extraction.service.ts`, routed by
  `services/api/src/rpc/routes/tasks.parse.ts`); unrelated to task creation.
- `POST /api/tasks` - direct single-task creation with the full scheduling
  field set (`dueAt`, `schedulingWindowStartAt`, `scheduledStartAt`,
  `participants`, ...) and an explicit `parentTaskId`/`artifactType`. This is
  the primitive the extraction flows build on, not itself reachable from
  chat.

## Current limitations

`task_list` is an application-level distinction, not a separate relational
family: a "list" is just a task row (`artifactType: 'task_list'`) with child
tasks pointing at it via `parentTaskId` on the shared `app.tasks` table. There
is no dedicated `task_lists` table, explicit ordering, or list-editing
workflow beyond what chat's create-tasks flow produces.
