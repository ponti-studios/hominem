# Chat Runtime Ownership

## Status

Accepted (2026-09-04)

## Decision

`@hominem/chat` owns the reusable chat plumbing used by studio applications and
services. Its server runtime owns generation lifecycle orchestration, tool
confirmation and idempotency, durable event sequencing, persistence-before-
publication, cancellation, retry, and final context accounting. Its client
runtime owns the canonical HTTP/SSE protocol, event parsing, deduplication,
replay, checkpoints, reconnection, and observable generation state.

The package remains portable through adapters. Providers, domain tools,
repositories, publishers, Redis, authentication, and platform transports are
injected at composition boundaries. The core does not import application
services, a database, React Query, Expo, or a specific provider.

Applications retain product-specific reactions such as cache invalidation,
optimistic UI, haptics, audio, navigation, and presentation. They consume the
package's typed lifecycle events rather than reproducing chat protocol logic.

## Consequences

Web and Omiro confirmation, send, start, regenerate, retry, cancellation, and
reload recovery all use the shared client/controller. The callback-based
`chat-sdk.ts` compatibility surface and the root projection reducer exports
were removed as part of this consolidation — do not reintroduce a
callback-shaped compatibility layer alongside the package runtime. The API
generation route delegates SSE framing to the package runtime and writes
final context accounting once per committed provider response; Hono retains
only authentication, validation, and adapter composition. Evidence and the
scenario matrix for this boundary live in
[chat.browser-playbook.md](../chat.browser-playbook.md).
