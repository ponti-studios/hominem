# Architecture

Hominem is a monorepo containing several products and shared packages. They do not all use the same path to reach data.

## How the parts connect

```text
Omiro
  -> RPC client and shared domain packages
  -> API
  -> database and infrastructure

Career browser
  -> Career server routes and services
  -> database and infrastructure

API
  -> authentication authority
  -> authorization context
  -> persistence and orchestration
```

- Omiro must use `@hominem/rpc` to access data.
- Career route's `loaders` and `actions` access the database directly. Browser components should use database-derived TypeScript types, but database handles and queries must stay on the server.
- Most protected RPC and MCP requests use the auth context created by the API's global auth middleware. The middleware resolves identity before route handling, and protected route middleware rejects requests without that context.
- The `/api/auth` routes are an exception. The global auth middleware skips them because they implement session and authentication operations, and those routes call Better Auth directly when they need the current session.
- The API is both a deployable service and the source of several client contracts. It exports `@hominem/api/types`, `@hominem/api/career`, and `@hominem/api/finance`; client packages consume those type contracts without using the API as a runtime dependency.
- Shared package entry points expose the public handles, types, errors, repositories, and helpers that each package supports. `@hominem/db` owns database access, repositories, schemas, and transactions; only server-owned code may import it directly, and client applications must use RPC instead of its runtime exports.
- Type-only imports do not create workspace dependency edges. Use a local TypeScript path alias when a package needs a source contract without a runtime dependency.

Omiro's route ownership and app-specific implementation details are documented in [the Omiro README](../apps/omiro/README.md).

Omiro is chat-first: its protected root resumes the most recent active chat or opens a focused New Chat composer. Chat history, All, Time, and Settings are secondary destinations. Native route presentation remains Expo Router-owned; shared chat transport, lifecycle, message, and cache contracts remain platform-neutral.

## Chat assistant behavior

Omiro's chat assistant is a private cognitive tool, not a performed character. It is clear, calm,
capable, respectful, and direct. It corrects flawed reasoning with an explanation and a better path,
but never uses sarcasm, mockery, shame, hostility, or emotional mirroring. It distinguishes facts,
uncertainty, assumptions, and recommendations; uses the shortest complete response; and asks a
follow-up only when necessary for a reliable answer. The API-owned `CHAT_ASSISTANT_PROMPT` is the
enforcement point for this contract.

## Data rules

- Use `just db codegen` to generate TypeScript types from the database schema. Do not hand-edit generated types.
- Validate all external input at runtime. Typed client code must still parse API responses before changing application state.
- Collections are neutral containers for any supported entity type. They have no domain-specific kind or place-list variant; places are simply one entity type that may be added through the collection item contract.
- Omiro's database is the source of truth for tasks and their scheduling intent. Calendar events are device-only EventKit data: Omiro does not mirror or synchronize them to Hominem's database. Apple Calendar is authoritative for calendar events; task data remains server-owned.
- Career engagements store work history and are typed as employment, contract, freelance, volunteer, or other. Portfolio projects are independent records and may optionally link to multiple engagements through `career_project_engagements`; they are not embedded in work history. Companies a user wants to work for are career applications with status `WISHLIST`; they are not engagements. Application status is a PostgreSQL enum: `WISHLIST`, `APPLIED`, `SCREENING`, `OFFER`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, or `WITHDRAWN`. Application stages retain company-specific labels and use the broad kinds `APPLICATION`, `SCREEN`, `OFFER`, and `OUTCOME`; `current_stage_id` points to the active stage-history record.
- All tests must use the test database.

## Open decisions

- **Public transport contract ownership** — Clients no longer depend on the deployable API package for runtime or type ownership.
- **Career data model** — One documented server/DB or API-backed model; database imports stay in its permitted layer.
- **Finance release tier** — README, CI, deployment configuration, and command scopes agree.
- **Better Auth bearer sessions** — Keep or remove the plugin with a tested external compatibility contract.
