# I. Product

Hominem is one product system. The API, Omiro, and every shared package exist
to make a person's work easier to capture, understand, continue, and act on.
The system earns complexity only when it removes friction from that loop.

## The active product shape

- **Omiro** is the Apple-native surface for capturing a thought, continuing a
  conversation, saving a note, and turning material into tasks.
- **API** is the authority for identity, persistence, orchestration, and work
  that must not be trusted to a client.
- **Career** is a web product with server-owned data access.
- **Finance** exists in the monorepo; its release tier is an explicit portfolio
  decision, never an accidental implication of a command or workflow.

## Omiro language

Words define product boundaries. Use them consistently.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| inbox | Signed-in root surface and mixed recent list. |
| chat | A conversation. |
| note | A saved note. |
| composer | The input surface that creates notes or starts chats. |
| task | An actionable item derived from a chat, note, or direct creation. |
| settings | Account and app settings. |
| archived chats | Conversations intentionally removed from the active flow. |

Do not use `workspace` as a product or module concept. Do not use `feed` as an
active app concept. Reserve `session` for authentication. Avoid `artifact` in
app-owned exports and feature names. When code needs a `chat | note` union,
name it explicitly (`ContentKind`, `ResumeTarget`) instead of abstracting it
into product language.

## Product laws

- Capture is immediate. A person can type, speak, attach context, or resume
  work without first configuring the system.
- The product names actual things. It does not hide ordinary work behind
  metaphors, slogans, or invented categories.
- AI assists with a visible human outcome: clearer text, a continued chat, or
  tasks a person can inspect and change. It is not a substitute for state,
  authority, or recoverability.
- A user never loses submitted meaning because a secondary automation fails.
  Raw text is preserved before optional cleanup; extracted task failures expose
  the transcript for recovery.
- Setup, permissions, and operational machinery stay out of the task surface
  until the person actually needs them.

## Product decision test

Before adding a feature, answer all four questions in the implementation:

1. What human work becomes easier?
2. What is the smallest visible outcome?
3. What does the person recover if automation, network, or permission fails?
4. Which existing product word and surface own it?

If those answers are unclear, the feature is not ready to spread across the
system.
